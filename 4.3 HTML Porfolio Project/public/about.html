<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I graduated from Concordia University Chicago with a BA in Computer Science,<br />
  as well as with a minor in Art. While obtaining my degree, I fell in love<br />
  with creating Fullstack applications. I enjoy seeing my work come to life in<br />
  realtime in the frontend, and figuring out how to protect users' data in the<br />
  backend. I believe the skills I have learned in school and my internship at<br />
  the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine will help me excel in a new<br />
  role as a Fullstack developer.</p>
